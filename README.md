In this repository we will discuss the very basics of Kali Linux. How to install it and setup on Virtual box. Discuss the few basics ethical hacking tools. 

**Objectives**

-Setup Kali Linux

-Learn Basic Ethical Hacking tools

**What is Kali Linux**

One of the major advantages of Kali Linux is its pre-installed selection of security tools. With over 600 tools readily available, including Nmap, Metasploit, Wireshark, and Aircrack-ng, users have immediate access to a wide range of functionalities for tasks such as network scanning, vulnerability assessment, password cracking, and wireless network analysis. This collection minimizes setup time and eliminates the need for downloading or configuring separate tools, allowing security professionals to jump straight into testing and analysis.

Its flexibility is particularly useful for hackers and security analysts who need an OS that can handle different testing setups without extensive reconfiguration.

**Ethical Hacking**

 Ethical hacking is the practice of legally testing computer systems and networks for vulnerabilities with the owner's permission, using the same techniques as malicious hackers but with the goal of improving security. It's a proactive approach to identify and address weaknesses before they can be exploited by cybercriminals. 

 There are 5 phases of Ethical Hacking:

 -Reconnaissance
 
 -Scanning
 
 -Gaining Access
 
 -Maintaining Access
 
 -Clearing Tracks
