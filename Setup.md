One of the major advantages of Kali Linux is its pre-installed selection of security tools. With over 600 tools readily available, including Nmap, Metasploit, Wireshark, and Aircrack-ng, users have immediate access to a wide range of functionalities for tasks such as network scanning, vulnerability assessment, password cracking, and wireless network analysis. This collection minimizes setup time and eliminates the need for downloading or configuring separate tools, allowing security professionals to jump straight into testing and analysis.

Its flexibility is particularly useful for hackers and security analysts who need an OS that can handle different testing setups without extensive reconfiguration.
